# Personal Flixster

Submitted by: **Kayla Son**

**Personal Flixster** is a movie-browsing app similar to Flixster. It uses Postman, a popular network debugging tool, and adds the ability to fetch real data from a third-party server. This includes collection views and tab bar controllers. It allows users to log into their account to track movies that have already been watched and personal ratings.

## Features

- [x] Implement network call and table view to display a list of movies currently playing (title, description, image)
